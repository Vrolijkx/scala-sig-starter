/*
ScalaTest also supports the behavior-driven development style, in which you
combine tests with text that specifies the behavior being tested. Here's
an example whose text output when run looks like:

A Map
- should only contain keys and values that were added to it
- should report its size as the number of key/value pairs it contains

import org.scalatest.FunSpec

import scala.collection.mutable.Stack

class ExampleFunSpec extends FunSpec {

  describe("A Stack") {

    it("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
      val stack = new Stack[Int]
      stack.push(1)
      stack.push(2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 1)
